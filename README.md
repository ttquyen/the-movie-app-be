# the-movie-app-be

Welcome to our movie application, where we dive deep into the world of cinema and bring you concise and comprehensive summaries of your favorite films.

The Movie App is a website project, where we will build the API list and database based on The Movie Database.

Users can see the list of popular, incoming, and top-rated films all over the world. They also can find their exciting films by searching and filtering their favorite genres.

Besides that users can add a movie to their favorite list, leave comments, and vote for films after enjoying them.
